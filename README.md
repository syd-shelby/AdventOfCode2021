# Advent Of Code 2021
Here I am posting my solutions to the advent of code challenges in 2021. Don't use this to cheat. Honestly it is probably pretty hastily written/ ugly code. Some days I might mis a challenge, not have a solution to part one, or put up code that doesn't work. This is just for me to track my progress and to compare solutions with other competitors once I'm done for the day. Also I have no clue what languages I'll use for these challenges, but I expect a lot of python3 and c++11
